<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>In leds, long pin (A) is the positive pin and the short one (C) is the negative one.<br>Resistance is important to protect the led from over voltage which prevent shortage, Also and most importantly it helps control the led power which affect how the led power on and how strong the light is.<br>Integrate 220 ohms resistor to achive best outcome.</p>
