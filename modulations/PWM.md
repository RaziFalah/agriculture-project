<h1>Short description</h1>
Pulse width modulation (PWM) is a modulation technique that generates variable-width pulses to represent the amplitude of an analog input signal. The output switching transistor is on more of the time for a high-amplitude signal and off more of the time for a low-amplitude signal.

<h1>How does PWM modulation work?</h1>
How PWM works. PWM works by switching the power device (such as a transistor, a diode, or an IGBT) on and off at a high frequency, while varying the duty cycle (the ratio of on-time to off-time) of the switch. The duty cycle determines the average output voltage and current of the converter.
